## Goal:
Develop a Faster R-CNN model ancillary to 
[TimelapsEr](https://github.com/SamuelClucas/SC_TSL_09092024_TimelapsEr) 
and the [imaging 
system](https://github.com/SamuelClucas/SC_TSL_06082024_Imaging-System-Design) 
to handle identification of plates, labels, and colonies, by the system 
within the incubator.
