Following on from analysis [03](03_ResNet50_setup.qmd): \
After one epoch of training, I now have some insight into how the code is behaving. Firstly, [standard error](results/error.txt) from the final code block of analysis 03 indicates a problem with the 'plot_eval_metrics' function from analysis [02](02_helper_training_functions.md). I think this is relatively benign and simple to fix. It's a new function I wrote hastily and I will rewrite it. \

More importantly though, I first want to inspect the loss_classifier, loss_objectness, loss_rpn_box_reg and loss metrics produced by the call to 'evaluate()' again defined in analysis [02](02_helper_training_functions.md). This function uses utility modules found in the [torchvision_deps](../../src/torchvision_deps/) folder. I think the data might hint at some unwanted behaviour in some of the network modules which must be identified and corrected in future development. \

**Purpose:** create plots from one epoch of training from analysis [03](02_helper_training_functions.md)'s standard output and explore the implications of these data on the functionality of analysis [02](02_helper_training_functions.md)'s helper training functions, as well as the utility modules in [torchvision_deps](../../src/torchvision_deps/). From this, I must correct any dysfunction prior to training on the cluster.
