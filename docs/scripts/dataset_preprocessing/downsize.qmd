### Purpose:
The libcamera_still_capture.sh script that drives the arducam module in [TimelapsEr](https://github.com/SamuelClucas/SC_TSL_09092024_TimelapsEr/tree/main) takes 4K images. I used Timelapser's start_timelapse.py script to create the image dataset to train models in this repo, hence my images are also in 4K. 

As in the reference [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01497), I need my input images to be scaled down so that their shortest side is 600 pixels in length. 

The following program crops the raw .png images down into composite images and scales them down. For the sake of space and time efficiency, I have included just one ['raw_example.png'](../../../train/images/raw_example/raw_example.png) image.

### Program Overview:

#### Imports:
```{python}
import cv2
import numpy as np
import time
from pathlib import Path
```


#### Main:
```{python}
#| output: false
if __name__ == '__main__':
    inputPath = Path('/Users/cla24mas/Documents/My_Repos/SC_TSL_15092024_Plate_Detect/train/images/raw_example/')
    outputPath = '/Users/cla24mas/Documents/My_Repos/SC_TSL_15092024_Plate_Detect/train/images/raw_example/downsized/'

    for img in inputPath.iterdir():
        if not img.name.startswith('.') and img.name.endswith('.png'):
            print(str(img))
            image = cv2.imread(img)

            sizeY = image.shape[0]
            sizeX = image.shape[1]
            
            mCols = 4
            nRows = 4

            for i in range(nRows):
                for j in range(mCols):
                    roi = image[i*int(sizeY/nRows):i*int(sizeY/nRows) + int(sizeY/nRows) , j*int(sizeX/mCols):j*int(sizeX/mCols) + int(sizeX/mCols)]

                    roi_sizeY = roi.shape[0]
                    roi_sizeX =  roi.shape[1]

                    scale_down = 600/min(roi_sizeY, roi_sizeX)
                    cv2.imwrite(outputPath + str(i) + '_' + str(j) + '_' + img.name, cv2.resize(roi, None, fx = scale_down, fy = scale_down, interpolation = cv2.INTER_LINEAR))
                    print("file saved")
                
```

**Breakdown:** \
- Each raw image is cropped into 4x4 composite images (16 sub-images per raw image), then scaled down so that their shortest side is 600 pixels long, like these:

![image](../../../train/images/mixed/0_0_0916161659.png){width=250}
![image](../../../train/images/mixed/0_1_0916161726.png){width=250}

- This is achieved by looping through each .png in the directory (here, just a single 'raw_example.png') in which another 2 for loops use [array slicing](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/numpy_array_slicing.asp) to crop the raw image into its composite sub-sections. 
- Each crop is stored in 'roi' which is scaled down so that its shortest side is 600 pixels long.
- Each roi is written to a csv file using [cv2.imwrite()](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-opencv-cv2-imwrite-method/). This way, the cropped image's aspect ratio is maintained (final dimensions: 600x799).
- Each crop is saved at the specified output path in the form 'row_column_MMDDhhmmss.png'.

After labelling plates in the images using LabelImg, I wrote a a simple [shell script](delete_unlabelled.sh) to copy the images that had at least one plate labelled to a new directory. This forms the basis of the [positive dataset](../../../train/images/positives), where there is at least one plate present in each image with a corresponding xml label file.

### Next step: convert xml label files into single csv file. See [xml_to_csv.py](xml_to_csv.md).
